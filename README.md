Using python and relevant libraries like tensorflow and sklearn, we intend to create a machine learning model capable of predicting occurrence of trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC). 

Our approach uses an auto encoder, a diverse selection of classifiers, and perturbation analysis of more complex models to not only predict mortality of TIC in our dataset with coagulation and proteomics data, but also quantitative describe features of most importance. 

Our model is capable of predicting mortality of TIC at > 95% accuracy. With effective feature selection to 2-3 features, an ICU can effective test patient blood for earlier stratification of patients in more mortal danger of TIC.

Analysis of the features selected may further provide insight into the biomechanics of TIC. 

This work is an ongoing summer project as a part of the Cellular Bioengineering REU at Rutgers University, with funding by the NSF.
